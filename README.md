# netpractice

A project focused on hands-on networking practice, designed to develop an understanding of TCP/IP addressing and small-scale network configuration.

This project involves solving networking problems to ensure proper network functionality. It consists of 10 levels, each presenting unique challenges for configuring network diagrams and achieving specific goals.

## Structure

### Project Overview

- **Training Levels**: You will configure small virtual networks through a web-based training interface. These networks simulate real network configurations but are not actual networks.
- **Levels 1-10**: Each level presents a broken network that needs to be reconfigured correctly to pass the level.

### Setup and Interface

1. **Download and Extract Files**: Start by downloading the project files and extracting them to your chosen directory.
2. **Open the Interface**: Run the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the training interface.
3. **Login**: Enter your login to begin practice mode, or leave the field empty to try the correction mode.

### Interface Functionality

- **Goals**: For each level, the goal is displayed at the top of the screen, describing the problem to be fixed.
- **Buttons**:
  - `Check again`: Validates your current configuration.
  - `Get my config`: Exports your current configuration for submission.
- **Logs**: Displays error messages to help troubleshoot and correct your configuration.

### Completion

- Successfully configuring the network on a level allows access to the next level.
- Export each configuration file after completing a level to submit in your Git repository.

## Features

- **TCP/IP Addressing**: Provides hands-on experience with IP addressing and subnetting.
- **Configuration Practice**: Offers practice in diagnosing and configuring network elements.
- **Error Feedback**: Includes logs to aid in identifying configuration issues.

## Usage

To start the practice session:

1. Download the project files and extract them to a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Enter your login to start practicing.

### Example Walkthrough

1. Open a level in the interface.
2. Review the goal and use the available tools to adjust IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing tables as needed.
3. Use `Check again` to verify your setup. Repeat adjustments until the network is functional.

## Submission

1. Export each level’s configuration using the `Get my config` button.
2. Save each configuration file in your Git repository, with one file per level at the root of the repository.
3. Submit the assignment by pushing all files to the repository as usual.

During evaluation, you’ll need to complete 3 random levels within a limited time, so be sure to practice and review the concepts of TCP/IP addressing and subnetting.
